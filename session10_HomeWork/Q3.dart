/*3. Unique Visitor Counter
You are building a mobile app that tracks unique visitors per day.
- Each visitor is identified by an ID (an integer).
- During the day, the app receives many repeated IDs (because the same user may open the app
multiple times).
- You need to count how many unique visitors used the app today.
Write code that, given a list of visitor IDs, returns the number of unique visitors. */
int countUnique(List<int> visitors) {
  return visitors.toSet().length;
}

void main() {
  List<int> visitors = [1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 7];
  int unique = countUnique(visitors);
  print('Number of unique visitors: $unique');
