/*What is the difference between var and dynamic in Dart? Provide an example of
each.

var:
The type is inferred from the assigned value and cannot change later
var name ="shahd";
name = 20;    <error>

dynamic:
The variable can hold any type and its type can change at runtime
dynamic value = "shahd";
value = 20;
