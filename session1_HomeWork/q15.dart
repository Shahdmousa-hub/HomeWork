/*What does it mean for Dart to be a statically-typed language, and how does it
impact the way variables are used?

<> Dart is statically_typed language which means that the type of a variable must
be defined when the code is written and it cannot change later

<> impact on using variables :
it make the code more readable and easier to understand 
it improves program performance 
it help catch errors at compile time instead of runtime
